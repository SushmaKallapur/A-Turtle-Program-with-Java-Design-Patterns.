# A-Turtle-Program-with-Java-Design-Patterns.
Interpreted the turtle language with specific commands using different Java design patterns.
Decoded text file of commands, using Interpreter pattern to develop an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Visitor pattern was used to handle the shortcomings of AST which returns a list of command objects for every operation.
Increased the flexibility using command processor which help to perform and reverse the program, one step at a time.
For better accessibility of the class, Decorator pattern was used.
